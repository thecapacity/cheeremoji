## Creation

`npm create cloudflare@latest -y -- --type hello-world-python --lang python -- telemetry disable`

## In Prod

`To have wrangler dev connect to your Workers KV namespace running on Cloudflare's global network, call wrangler dev --remote instead. This will use the preview_id of the KV binding configuration in the wrangler.toml file. This is how a wrangler.toml file looks with the preview_id specified.` - https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/concepts/kv-bindings/#use-kv-bindings-when-developing-locally

Routing

```Set up a route in the dashboard
Before you set up a route, make sure you have a DNS record set up for the domain or subdomain you would like to route to.
To set up a route in the dashboard:
Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard â†— and select your account.
Go to Workers & Pages and in Overview, select your Worker.
Go to Settings > Triggers > Routes > Add route.
Enter the route and select the zone it applies to.
Select Add route.```
